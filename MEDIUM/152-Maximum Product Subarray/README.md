Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 2 * 104
	-10 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10
	The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
