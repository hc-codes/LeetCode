Example 1:


Input: head = [4,2,1,3]

Example 2:


Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]


Example 3:


Input: head = []
Output: []


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
	-105 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 105


&nbsp;
Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)?
