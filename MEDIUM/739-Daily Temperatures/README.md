Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example 1:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
Example 3:
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

Constraints:


	1 &lt;=&nbsp;temperatures.length &lt;= 105
	30 &lt;=&nbsp;temperatures[i] &lt;= 100
