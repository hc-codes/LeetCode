The beauty of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.


	For example, the beauty of &quot;abaacc&quot; is 3 - 1 = 2.


Given a string s, return the sum of beauty of all of its substrings.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;aabcb&quot;
Output: 5
Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are [&quot;aab&quot;,&quot;aabc&quot;,&quot;aabcb&quot;,&quot;abcb&quot;,&quot;bcb&quot;], each with beauty equal to 1.

Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;aabcbaa&quot;
Output: 17


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 500
	s consists of only lowercase English letters.
