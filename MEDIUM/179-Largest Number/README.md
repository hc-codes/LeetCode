Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: &quot;210&quot;


Example 2:


Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: &quot;9534330&quot;


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100
	0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 109
