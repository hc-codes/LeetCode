Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;the sky is blue&quot;
Output: &quot;blue is sky the&quot;


Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;  hello world  &quot;
Output: &quot;world hello&quot;
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.


Example 3:


Input: s = &quot;a good   example&quot;
Output: &quot;example good a&quot;
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 104
	s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces &#39; &#39;.
	There is at least one word in s.


&nbsp;
Follow-up:&nbsp;If the string data type is mutable in your language, can&nbsp;you solve it&nbsp;in-place&nbsp;with&nbsp;O(1)&nbsp;extra space?
