Given an integer array nums where&nbsp;every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must&nbsp;implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use&nbsp;only constant&nbsp;extra space.

&nbsp;
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 3 * 104
	-231 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 231 - 1
	Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
