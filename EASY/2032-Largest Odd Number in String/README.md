You are given a string num, representing a large integer. Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a non-empty substring of num, or an empty string &quot;&quot; if no odd integer exists.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: num = &quot;52&quot;
Output: &quot;5&quot;
Explanation: The only non-empty substrings are &quot;5&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;52&quot;. &quot;5&quot; is the only odd number.


Example 2:


Input: num = &quot;4206&quot;
Output: &quot;&quot;
Explanation: There are no odd numbers in &quot;4206&quot;.


Example 3:


Input: num = &quot;35427&quot;
Output: &quot;35427&quot;
Explanation: &quot;35427&quot; is already an odd number.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= num.length &lt;= 105
	num only consists of digits and does not contain any leading zeros.
