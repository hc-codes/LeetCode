The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows:&nbsp;

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n &gt;= 0.

Given n, return the value of Tn.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4


Example 2:


Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	0 &lt;= n &lt;= 37
	The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, ie. answer &lt;= 2^31 - 1.
