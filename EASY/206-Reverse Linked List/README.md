# Reverse Linked List

**Difficulty**: Easy

**Tags**: Linked List, Recursion

---

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]


Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]


Example 3:


Input: head = []
Output: []


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
	-5000 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 5000


&nbsp;
Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
