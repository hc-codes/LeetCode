Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].


Example 2:


Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 104
	-104 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 104
	nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


&nbsp;
Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?
