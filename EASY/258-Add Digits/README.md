Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --&gt; 3 + 8 --&gt; 11
11 --&gt; 1 + 1 --&gt; 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.


Example 2:


Input: num = 0
Output: 0


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	0 &lt;= num &lt;= 231 - 1


&nbsp;
Follow up: Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
