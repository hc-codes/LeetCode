Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal&#39;s triangle.

In Pascal&#39;s triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

&nbsp;
Example 1:
Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
Example 2:
Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]
Example 3:
Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1,1]

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	0 &lt;= rowIndex &lt;= 33


&nbsp;
Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?
