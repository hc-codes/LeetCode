Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes&#39; values.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: root = [1,null,2,3]

Output: [1,2,3]

Explanation:




Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]

Output: [1,2,4,5,6,7,3,8,9]

Explanation:




Example 3:


Input: root = []

Output: []


Example 4:


Input: root = [1]

Output: [1]


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
	-100 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 100

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
