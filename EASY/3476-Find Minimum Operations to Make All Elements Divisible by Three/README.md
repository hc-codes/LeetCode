You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from any element of nums.

Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums divisible by 3.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 3

Explanation:

All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:


	Subtract 1 from 1.
	Add 1 to 2.
	Subtract 1 from 4.



Example 2:


Input: nums = [3,6,9]

Output: 0

Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 50
	1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 50
