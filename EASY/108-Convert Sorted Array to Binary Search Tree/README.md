Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:



Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 104
	-104 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 104
	nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
