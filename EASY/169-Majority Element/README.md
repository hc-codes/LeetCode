Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than &lfloor;n / 2&rfloor; times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

&nbsp;
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	n == nums.length
	1 &lt;= n &lt;= 5 * 104
	-109 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 109


&nbsp;
Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
