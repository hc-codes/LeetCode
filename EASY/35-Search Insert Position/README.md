Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must&nbsp;write an algorithm with&nbsp;O(log n) runtime complexity.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1


Example 3:


Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 104
	-104 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 104
	nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
	-104 &lt;= target &lt;= 104
