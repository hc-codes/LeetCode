Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]


Example 2:


Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums1.length, nums2.length &lt;= 1000
	0 &lt;= nums1[i], nums2[i] &lt;= 1000
