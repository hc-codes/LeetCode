# Reverse Nodes in k-Group

**Difficulty**: Hard

**Tags**: Linked List, Recursion

---

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list&#39;s nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]


Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the list is n.
	1 &lt;= k &lt;= n &lt;= 5000
	0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?
